# ElliottProject6

Created a hash table, using the built in libraries for C#, to store words from a text file. Hash value is computed by the ASCII code of the characters in the word and then summed together. GUI allows the user to enter a word, and then the program searches the hash table to see if the word is in the hash table or not.
